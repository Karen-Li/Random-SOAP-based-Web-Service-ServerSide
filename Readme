Two configuration files are needed to deploy web service.

web.xml:
- Load a WSServletContextListener to parses sun-jaxws.xml
- Load a WSServlet to dispatch incoming requests
sun-jaxws.xml:
- dispatch all incoming requests to RandService

RandService can be deployed by:
ant -Dwar.name=rand deploy


Once deployed:

curl http://localhost:8080/rand?xsdl
returns the WSDL associated with the service.
curl http://localhost:8080/rand?xsd=1
returns the XML Schema associated with the service.


The client in the random project can be modified to go against the Tomcat-deployed version by changing the URLs.

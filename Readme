Two configuration files are needed to deploy web service.

web.xml:
- WSServletContextListener: parses sun-jaxws.xml
- WSServlet: dispatches incoming requests /* to RandService
sun-jaxws.xml:
dispatches incoming requests /* to RandService

RandService can be deployed by:
ant -Dwar.name=rand deploy

Once deployed:
returns the WSDL associated with the service.
curl http://localhost:8080/rand?xsd=1
returns the XML Schema associated with the service.


The client in the random project can be modified to go against the Tomcat-deployed version by changing the URLs.
